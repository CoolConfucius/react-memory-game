issues getting messy. 
notes start here. 

react made decision react is agonna update in dom...
understandign life cycle hooks is what takes you from beginer to medium react dev

Event pooling
you have synthesized event object. can't use it asynchronisly. react reuses this event. 
null because react is doign event pooling. 

Controlled components
...

warning cuz out of sync with state? 

enchance fake browser to be in sync with input. 
so when i type in the dom, i really wan tto tye p in the fake broswr. respect the facke browser. we can wrtie some short cod tot make it into the fake broswer. 
we replace the typing behvior with something in react. 
block me from typing? what happens is, when you type, react resets the value to 42. the staet doesn't change. state value is 42. rerender to 42. it looks like you can't type. 

import React from "react";


class Test extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { x: 42 };
  }
  handleChange(event){
    console.log(event.target.value);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Testing Controlled Components
        <br />
        {this.state.x}
        <br />
        <input value={this.state.x}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Test;
